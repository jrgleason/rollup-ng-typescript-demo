# Demo of creating a UMD based Angular project

## Why

I prefer to be as vanilla in terms of ECMAScript as possible. However, there are some times where this is either inconvient or impossible. When I use Rollup is allows me the flexibility to output my bundle in any module spec available. However, the documentation on how to do this cleanly in Angular is basically nonexistent. So I made an example project to show people how to do it properly.

## How to run

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run rollup`
1. Open the Test.html file in a web browser

## Coming soon

1. Add Service and Component examples.

P.R.s and comments welcome!
